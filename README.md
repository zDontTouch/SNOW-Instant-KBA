# SNOW-Instant-KBA
The Instant KBA is a script tool for the SAP Integrated Support Environment which adds a little draggable box where users can directly add KBAs to open cases without the regular steps.

Normally, users must click on the "Solution" menu, then click on the "Attach KBA" option from the dropdown to open the KBA list popup page. Then users must paste the KBA ID and click on Attack before being able to close the popup.
With this extension, users can simply type the ID of the KBA in the textbox and hit enter to add the KBA through a script in a background tab. Users can even paste the whole ID+Title of the KBA, as the tool will automaticaly trim the ID.

The extension also has a built-in list with all the bridge KBAs, which can be added in a single click:
